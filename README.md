> "In the Age of Fragmentation, Own Your Story. We live in a world saturated by fleeting moments‚Äînotifications that vanish, conversations lost to time, memories displaced by the next demand for attention. In this era of ephemera, there is a quiet rebellion: reclaiming not just the right to our data but to our existence as a continuous narrative."

- Close unnecessary applications

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How much disk space does rec-all use?**
  A: Storage usage varies based on:
  - Screen resolution
  - Capture interval
  - Enabled features (OCR/AI)
  For example, at 1080p with 5-second intervals, expect roughly 70-200MB per hour.

**Q: Does rec-all work with multiple monitors?**
  A: No, rec-all only captures the main monitor.

**Q: Can I change the capture interval?**
  A: Yes, you can adjust the interval in the settings menu (minimum: 1 second).

**Q: Does rec-all require internet?**
  A: Internet is only required during initial setup for downloading language models and AI components. After setup, rec-all works completely offline.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
  A: All captures are stored locally in your chosen recording directory.

**Q: Will rec-all start automatically with Windows?**
  A: No, you need to manually start rec-all each time you want to use it.

**Q: Can I use rec-all without the AI features?**
  A: Yes, AI features are optional. You can use rec-all with just basic screen capture, or enable OCR without AI descriptions.

**Q: What happens if my computer crashes during recording?**
  A: rec-all saves each capture independently, so you'll only lose the most recent unsaved capture. Previous captures remain safe.

## üéÅ Future Vision

We envision a world where every individual owns their digital shadow. Where data is not the currency of surveillance capitalism but the fabric of personal sovereignty. rec-all is our contribution to that world: a tool for those who wish to live deliberately, remembering deeply, and owning fully.
